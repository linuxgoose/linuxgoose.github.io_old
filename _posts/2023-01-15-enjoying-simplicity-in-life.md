Last year I had a big revelation.Unfortunately, it was triggered by a devastating event that was not fun to deal with and nor was it easy.

Fortunately, though, it led me to a life-changing shower-thought that has stuck with me for many months thus far and perhaps permanently — I hope.

Early last year I began questioning if I had succumbed to the ever growing trend to be busy all the time looking for my next big move or million dollar idea. It was fuelled by the thought that by my mid-to-late twenties I would need to be making six-figures or more with all the knowledge in the world.

I pondered this for a moment.

I was coming up to my mid-twenties territory working a full-time job in conjunction with working part-time as an IT contractor while also attending university part-time to get my undergraduate degree.

There was no doubt I was absolutely overflowing my capacity in every category possible. But, wasn’t that okay? We’re constantly assured that working 60–80 hours a week is how we succeed. We have to put the work in now to reap the rewards later… right?

Not really. It was not, and is not, sustainable.

Thankfully, the year prior I had completed my undergraduate degree which was a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders and freed up my evenings and weekends… as the stupid kid I was, a bit of a “lifestyle creep” scenario occurred where I just shifted this newfound free time to my contracting work. For a little while this worked and I was able to learn a lot and complete a lot of projects.

Although, last year I had decided to take time off of my contracting work to recover my mind and I only took on small jobs for existing clients.

It was a rough time in my life. Maybe even top three of the most difficult periods of time that I have had to handle.

Despite all of this, though, I found myself actually happier than I was beforehand.

This was my moment of revelation.

I took a step back, closed my eyes, and just sat there. Thinking through every possible scenario as to why I felt happier.

Prior to the aforementioned event in my life I had everything one could ask for. I had a great job, a successful contracting business, gadgets to appease my tech nerd side, an education, a family — pets included of course.

I couldn’t think of what else had changed besides taking time off of my contracting business.

Then it dawned upon me. Time.

I had gained the most precious thing in life that enables a multiplier to other joy-bringing aspects of my existence.

I replaced an exhausting grind with relaxing quality time with my family and friends. I replaced stressful client meetings with refreshing sleep. I replaced the race for a dollar with a race in the park with my dog.

In other words — I was enjoying a simpler life.

Now, don’t get me wrong, I did initially struggle with the fact that I was not being productive. My whole life up until this point was to be nothing but productive. However, looking at it from a more simplistic lens, perhaps I still am being productive?

Productivity does not have to be about producing goods and services to fuel the capitalistic economy so we can earn a few bucks to in return by those goods and services.

One can instead be productive by producing joy for themselves and others, by producing memories for themselves and their loved ones, by producing a simple and relaxing life for their mind.

Despite what society tries to tell us, it is okay to take time for off for yourself and to just relax. Relaxing does not mean you are being unproductive. It just means your productivity has been shifted to produce an intrinsic service to yourself and to your loved ones.

Which. Is. Okay.

In the wise words of Bell Hooks, “living simply makes loving simple”.

I’ve learned to love my surroundings more as I’ve been able to effortlessly notice the beauty that surrounds our everyday ordinary lives. The silly moments of human interactions or that funny moment when a cat realizes they may not actually be the boss in the house and do actually need us for sustenance.

Life is beautiful. Seek out what makes you happy and do not fuss about what makes you unhappy.
