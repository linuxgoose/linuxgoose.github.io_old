It is no surprise that artificial intelligence like ChatGPT and the ever-growing reliance on technology has many both optimistic, but scared for the future.

The innovative solutions to problems and overall efficiencies that have or will come, could change lives — have changed lives.

But I, like a number of people, also have reservations on what it means for society and overall communication on a human level.

Technological advances have enabled our world to be the most connected world year-over-year. More people than ever before have been able to communicate with a mind-boggling amount of new individuals from all walks of life.

I tried explaining this to my grandad a few years ago (who is turning 100 years old this year) and his jaw hit the floor, but he still couldn’t quite wrap his head around it.

It simply, and literally, was just unbelievable.

However, if we take a step back and think about it, are we overall more connected with the world at the cost of being less connected with those around us at a human level?

The answer, whether we like it or not, is almost certainly yes.

Think about it.

In a usual day-to-day, think about if you have a question for a co-worker. More often than not, that communication is likely going to be done in an email or through an instant messaging channel — even if the said co-worker is a few feet from you.

Similarly, after work when you’ve decided what you want for take out, most people’s initial question is, “Can I just order this online?” rather than picking up a phone to speak with someone.

Unfortunately, corporations have picked up on this and are now leaning into it hard and making it even more of a problem.

Now, I am not saying this is inherently bad or we all need to stop digitally communicating — far from it.

If the last few years with COVID-19 has taught us anything it is that using technology to communicate with friends, family, and co-workers is immensely efficient and effective and without a doubt has its place in the world.

The key word is… place.

We as humans still require those good ol’ fashioned face-to-face and eye contacts. There is no amount of video calls that can replace them completely — only supplement.

Society is heading towards (while some may even argue we already are there) a direction where there are two distinct worlds we are living in: the physical and the digital.

It is a tough question as to whether it would be better to merge the two so we have one foot in either or if we need to lean into maintaining a life in both.

Either way, though, we must be cognizant of which provides the human connection that tells the whole picture that the other just can’t quite complete.

I have a challenge for everyone who has gotten to this part in the article.

The next time you need to speak with a co-worker, take a path that requires at least a little bit of human connection.

Take a walk over to their desk or pick up a phone.

Ordering a pizza? Opt for a phone call instead of filling a form out online.

Try this out for at least one week. Note how you felt before the challenge and then after.

Do you feel more connected?

Do you feel less lonely?

It is time to combat the paradox of loneliness in the most connected world humans have ever experienced.
