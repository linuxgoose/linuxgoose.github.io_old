I get asked a lot about the tools I use to build software, stay productive and organised, or buy to keep me productive and on top of things. Here’s a big list of all my favorite stuff.

### Workstation (14” MacBook Pro, M2 Pro, 16GB RAM (2023))

I was using an Intel-based 15” MacBook Pro (Late 2016) prior to this and the difference is night and day. I’ve never heard the fans turn on a single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it through with the number of applications and VMs (Parallels Windows 11) open. Nevermind the massive Football Manager 2024 databases I use.

### OneBag (Red Original Waterproof Backpack - 30L)

An unconventional choice for a OneBag, but one that has checked the most boxes for me - namely the 100% waterproof main compartment. However, the more outdoorsy focus of the bag provides features that more urban travel bags seem to turn the heads away from. The bag features dual water bottle holders, molle webbing and anchor points, and bungee cords that can be used to hold walking poles, provide extra security for your water bottles, or hold a jacket or wet towel.

### Development tools

#### Visual Studio Code

I don’t use many of the super fancy extensions nor am I wizard with the keyboard shortcuts, but I'd be reluctant to say this is not the correct choice for many teams. And, of course, bonus points for it being open-source.

#### GitHub

I enjoy GitLab as well. The CI/CD capabilities of both will do. But, GitHub being as widely used as it is just fits into my workflow better as less technical clients will often know GitHub over GitLab making the onboarding/off-boarding of clients more seamless. That being said, GitLab tempts me fairly often with the customisation possibilities. GitHub keeps things simple which does have its place, however.
    
#### Google Cloud

My preferred platform for managing our (and client) infrastructure. Cloud Run pairs nicely with GitHub Actions to keep simple projects simple, but has the capability to scale when needed.
