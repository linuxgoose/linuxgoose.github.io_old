title: About me
subtitle: I’m Jordan Robinson. I am a software enthusiast and open-source advocate aiming to make the future better.

I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote my first program when I was 14 years old. From then on, I've been making websites and web applications for fun and for all sorts of clients.

The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was sports (and video games based on the real life sport). Looking at you Madden and Football Manager 20XX.

Today, I’m the founder of Fenwig Technologies Ltd, where we’re working on leveraging automation to build custom solutions for our clients that will enable them to become more efficient and data-driven.
